Hand Gesture Recognition with CNN
This project is part of my internship work and focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model 
for classifying hand gestures using the LeapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains grayscale images 
representing different hand gestures, commonly used in gesture-based control systems.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
TensorFlow, Keras – For model building and training
matplotlib – For visualizing training history
kagglehub – To download the dataset directly from Kaggle
ImageDataGenerator – For efficient image preprocessing and augmentation
